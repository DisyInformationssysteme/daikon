= Daikon Spring Auth
:toc:

This module provides support for Service Accounts authentication in a reactive application. +
It introduces `Auth0ReactiveAuthenticationManager` which will validate headers populated by passthrough-auth service (Gloo) or parse Auth0 JWT itself issued for service account.

In case not all headers are found and token is not SAT, authentication is done by other managers through the `TalendReactiveAuthenticationManagerResolver`: Talend JWT or Opaque token. +
`AuthUserDetails` will be populated into SecurityContext in case of successful authentication, usages of old class `UserDetails` have to be renamed.

== Usage

- *Authentication:* set correct `Authentication` context for the session depending on the token type
- *Exchange Filter:* forward SAT headers to the next request


== Adding dependency

- `oidc-client` is not compatible with reactive application, so remove it if you have it in your path
- add `daikon-spring-reactive-auth` dependency

To start supporting SAT itâ€™s necessary to add the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.talend.daikon</groupId>
    <artifactId>daikon-spring-reactive-auth</artifactId>
    <version>${daikon.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

== Authentication

Add Authentication to your context by using the default `ReactiveAuthenticationManagerResolver` bean `talendAuthenticationManagerResolver` in your security chain to get the correct authentication manager for the session, dependending on the request (see implementation).

_example_:
```java
@EnableWebFluxSecurity
@EnableReactiveMethodSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration {

    private final ReactiveAuthenticationManagerResolver<ServerWebExchange> talendAuthenticationManagerResolver;

    public SecurityConfiguration(ReactiveAuthenticationManagerResolver<ServerWebExchange> talendAuthenticationManagerResolver)
    {
        this.talendAuthenticationManagerResolver = talendAuthenticationManagerResolver;
    }

    @Bean
    public SecurityWebFilterChain privateApiSecurityWebFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
        return http
            .authorizeExchange()
            .anyExchange()
            .authenticated()
            .and()
            .oauth2ResourceServer()
            .authenticationManagerResolver(talendAuthenticationManagerResolver)
            .and()
            .build();
    }

}
```

In order to handle an Auth0 token, you must add an the Auth0 url to `spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri` value in your `application.[yaml|yml|properties]` file.

== Exchange Filter

Forward the SAT headers to the next request by adding the `Auth0ExchangeFilterFunction` to your `WebClient` definition.

_example:_
```java
    @Bean
    public WebClient webClient() {
        return WebClient
            .builder()
            .filter(new Auth0ExchangeFilterFunction())
            [...]
            .build();
    }
```
