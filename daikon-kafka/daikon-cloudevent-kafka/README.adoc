= Daikon Cloud Event Kafka

== Overview

Daikon Cloud Event Kafka library provides a simple way to send and receive events using Kafka based on Talend Kafka Policy.

It provides a serializer and a deserializer for CloudEvent (binary content mode) + schema based content.

== Example

Please look at `daikon-cloud-event-example-consumer` and `daikon-cloud-event-example-producer` for a complete example.

Be careful that by default confluent serializer do not activate failure on invalid schema. You need to set the following properties to true to activate it:

[source,java]
----
    configProps.put("json.fail.invalid.schema", true);
----
